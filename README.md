<h1>Search Engine</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<br>In this project, I developed a search engine with a focus on preprocessing documents and implementing efficient search algorithms. The search engine processes a given set of documents, creating an AVL Search Tree, Hashtable and vectors to store unique words along with document details and word frequencies. The system supports case-insensitive word processing, ignoring non-alphabetical characters. Users input queries, and the engine outputs the document names where all query words appear, along with their respective frequencies.

The project involves comparing the speed of different data structures and sorting algorithms. Input documents are stored in a vector, and various sorting algorithms, including Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Heap Sort, are applied to assess efficiency. The search algorithms, binary search tree, hash table, and binary search on sorted vectors, are evaluated for their search speed. The project provides insights into the effectiveness of different algorithms and structures, contributing to the optimization of search engine architectures.
